_______________________________________________________________________________

This tool will seperate the lines of idocs that are placed in a specified 
folder (should be C:\Program Files\idoc_split\uploaded-docs), which will open 
in an explorer window at runtime.

You will need Python installed to run this program.
_______________________________________________________________________________
To change the output file location:
You must edit the FILE_PATH.json file.
DO NOT UPDATE 'base_dir' OR 'output_dir' UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
To have the program output to somewhere other that the output_dir, 
enter an absolute path to a directory in the quotations next to the
'alt_output' option bellow. 
If there is an issue with the path you've entered the program will place
the output file in the 'output_dir' directory
PLEASE CHANGE THE 'alt_output' OPTION BACK WHEN YOU'RE DONE
